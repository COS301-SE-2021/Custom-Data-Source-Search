DataSleuth is a custom data source search system. It provides software developers 
with a central system from where they can search all the data sources they use for 
their work. From local files, code repositories, wikis, databases, 
websites and communication systems, all the way to user specific esoteric
data sources that competent software developers plug in to the system for themselves.

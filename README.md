DataSleuth is to a custom data source search system. It provides software developers 
with a central system from which they can search all the data sources they use for 
their work. This would include local files, code repositories, wikis, databases, 
specific websites and communication systems - it could also include user specific
data sources, and as such the system allows software developers to use their 
expertise to easily plug in any esoteric data sources they might wish to.

A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul,
like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.
I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot,
which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.
I am so happy, my dear Jeff, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence,
that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single Jeff at the present moment;
and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.
